      <h2>Advocate for Climate Justice</h2>

      <p>
        Developed nations and large corporations are major contributors to
        climate change, while small island nations like Fiji bear the brunt of
        its impacts. It's crucial to advocate for stronger emission reductions
        and financial support for adaptation and mitigation in vulnerable
        regions.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        Your action item today is to contact policymakers in developed nations
        or representatives of international climate organizations. Urge them to
        commit to ambitious emission reduction targets and increase climate
        finance for Small Island Developing States.
